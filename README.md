# WiFi Distribution Mapping 🗺️📶

## Overview

This project provides a set of simulations of the electric field distribution generated by a WiFi router placed at various positions within an apartment floor plan. The simulation data are used to train an AI algorithm capable of reconstructing the indoor WiFi signal distribution, given only the router’s location as input.

The codebase features a Streamlit graphical interface for easy interaction and visualization of both simulations and AI-generated reconstructions.

## 🚀 Features
Simulation Dataset – Electric field measurements for multiple router placements inside a predefined apartment layout.

AI Reconstruction Engine – Trains a machine‑learning model to predict the WiFi signal map from router coordinates.

Interactive Interface – Built with Streamlit for:

Visualizing simulation output,

Running inference on new positions,

Comparing AI predictions to ground truth.

## 🧠 Architecture

-Simulation Module – Generates labeled data: each input is a router position → output is a 2D electric‑field intensity grid.

-Preprocessing – Normalizes and formats simulation results for model ingestion.

-AI Model – Could be a convolutional or fully connected neural network that learns to map coordinates to grid outputs.

-Streamlit UI – Connects user input (router position) to model inference and visualizes results.
